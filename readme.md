### Sobre o livro ###
<p>This book aims to present some of the possibilities of the mobile application development scenario, a market with constant demand for professionals and solutions. 
  The work has a practical step-by-step section for creating functional applications with very few lines of code, without the need for a great technical background, 
  but which can be the starting point for you to embark on this incredible journey.</p>

### Before you begin ###
Before you even start developing your applications using the **Android** operating system, you need to prepare the device to receive your apps.
On the device, you need to run a sequence of commands to enable *Developer Mode* and from there activate **USB Debugging**.
